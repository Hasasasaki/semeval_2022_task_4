"The Annual Education Report (ASER) was launched in Islamabad on Wednesday, revealing some interesting facts and figures. It noted that the number of off-campus children due to government data has dropped from 25 million to 22 million. But there is more work to be done. Without compromising schooling, the focus should be on improving quality. The current education budget allocation is now 3.02% of GDP, up from 2.83% last year, but it still fails to meet its target. The decline in this situation is that 19% of children aged 6-16 still leave school. The remaining 81% also didn’t learn much in the 6-16-year-old age group. The seventh ASER survey also highlighted that children in private schools performed better in the past compared to trends in learning in public schools. The number of children outside the school should attract the attention of the entire country, especially the federal and provincial governments. It is obvious that poverty is the main reason for keeping children away from school and forcing them to do some work to help supplement their family’s income. If the number of public schools increases meaningfully, this problem can be addressed to a large extent. Public schools rarely charge or do not charge fees, but these fees are not enough to meet the needs of population growth. Participation in distance factors and unbearable travel expenses also prohibits parents from sending their children to school. Private schools are excited in urban and rural areas, and they cater to the needs of the mid- and high-income sectors of society, but poor families cannot get their children to be attracted to them. Their owners should also be aware that they also assume social and state obligations and provide a percentage of total enrollment for students from the poorest families for free. There are also issues with facilities, the qualifications of teaching staff and the quality of education provided, and at least the government should provide training facilities for all teachers employed by private schools.",0
