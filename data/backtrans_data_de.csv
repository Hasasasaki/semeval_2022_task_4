"The annual report of the state of State of Education (ASER), launched on Wednesday in Islamabad, reveals some of the interesting facts and numbers. It is pointed out that access to education in Pakistan has made increasing progress because the number of children outside the school has dropped from 25 to 22 million. However, there is more to do. Without affecting access to school, the focus should be on improving quality. The allocation of the educational budget is now 3.02% of GDP, compared to 2.83% last year, but not yet before the finish. The closer side of the situation is that 19% children between the ages of 6 and 16 are not yet at school. The remaining 81%, which are recorded in the age group from 6 to 16 years, do not learn much either. The seventh Azer survey report was also highlighted in accordance with the past trends that children who are inscribed in private schools than those who study at state schools do better. The number of children outside of school should be a reason for the entire nation and in particular for federal and provincial governments. It is quite obvious that poverty is the main cause that keeps the children away from the schools and forces them to work something to add the income of their families. The problem can be tackled to a large extent if the number of state schools is increased sensibly. The state schools raise little or no fee, but these are not sufficient to meet the needs of the growing population. The distance factor and the participation of unbearable travel expenses also prohibit parents of sending their children in schools. Private schools have shaped mushrooms in both urban and rural areas and require the need for medium and high income segments of society, but poor families cannot afford to include their children in these schools. Your owners should also recognize that they also have social and national obligations and offer students from the poorest of the poor families who are free of charge free of charge. There are also questions from the institutions, qualifications of the teaching staff and the quality of education that is mediated, and the government should at least offer training courses, including those who are employed at private schools.",0
