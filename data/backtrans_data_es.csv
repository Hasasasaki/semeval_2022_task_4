"The Annual Education State Report (ASER) launched in Islamabad on Wednesday reveals some of the interesting facts and figures. He points out that there have been progress in increasing access to education in Pakistan, since the number of children outside the school has decreased from 25 million to 22 million according to government data. However, there is more to do. Without compromising access to school, the approach must be to improve quality. The assignment of the education budget is now 3.02% of GDP, compared to 2.83% last year, but it is not yet aim. The negative side of the situation is that 19% of children 6 to 16 are still out of school. The remaining 81% that is registered at the age level of 6-16 is not learning much either. The seventh report of the ASER survey also stood out according to the previous trends that children enrolled in private schools work better compared to those who study in government schools. The number of children outside the school must be a matter of concern for the entire nation and especially for federal and provincial governments. It is quite obvious that poverty is the main cause that keeps children away from schools and forces them to do some work to help complement their families' income. The problem can be addressed to a large extent if the number of government schools increases significantly. Government schools charge little or no fee, but these are not enough to meet the needs of the growing population. The distance factor and the participation of unbearable travel expenses also prohibit parents to send their children to schools. Private schools have multiplied both in urban and rural areas and are attending to the need for average and high income segments of society, but poor families cannot afford their children to admit in these schools. Its owners must also realize that they also have social and national obligations and offer some percentage of total admissions to the students of the poorest families of poor families. There are also facilities problems, teaching staff qualifications and the quality of education that are taught and the government should, at least, offer training facilities to all teachers, including those employed by private schools.",0

The conditions in the warehouse are increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped delivering food and basic supplies. ""I come from Djibouti to work.

Khaled Al-Elwany, a local official who until recently supervised the deportation of migrants back to their countries of origin, says that up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at the city's control points each month. Elwany says he was fired by the Ministry of Interior for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center in a neighboring province and after the authorities arrested food supplies. An official of the Ministry told Reuters that the objective of the move to a new installation had been to improve the conditions for migrants while waiting for deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab allies mostly of the Gulf are struggling to restore Yemen's exiled government to power and reverse the Hutí movement aligned with Iran. While the government nominally controls Aden and other areas of the South, a budget and rivalries with local armed groups mean that its officials reside mainly abroad.
