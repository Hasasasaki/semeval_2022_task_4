"Dr Mayengbam Lalit Singh Recently honourable PM of India launched scheme called "" Doubling Farmers ' Income "" in order to uplift the welfare being of larger portion of Indians . The big questions felt by people are ( i ) How would it be possible in short period of time ? And ( ii ) is it an elusive doctrine to sweep vote bank of millions of farmers for upcoming parliamentary election in 2019 ? Across all over India ( except for a few states ) so many rigidities have to be solved in order to raise the real income of farmers . These rigidities are characterised by infrastructures , structures and institutions . The present article focuses on those rigidities only for Manipur which has been lagging behind many Indian states . Regarding infrastructure ( inputs ) , the state is found backward among those backward states of India . Introspecting water infrastructure , the state has been under-utilising water resources despite the abundant availability . For Kharif season crops farmers rely on rain water since the state is under the map of SE monsoon . However , during Rabi and Zayed seasons the state has been witnessing scarcity of water . In order to curb this shortage , government needs construction of multiple check dams and digging bore wells in those small streams flowing across the plain areas . During peak season , there is always a shortage of manures and pesticides due to landslide on national highways . Revolution of organic farming will lessen dependency on chemical fertilisers since the state has high potential of producing organic manures and pesticides . During post harvesting period , the state needs to construct cold storages so that perishable crops can be stored for agricultural off seasons . Regarding financial support to farming , banks are not integrated with farmers . Moreover state government does not organise crop insurance schemes in order to compensate the loss due to natural calamity . My previous article on "" Channelizing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ) with Crop and Livestock Insurances in India "" postulates the model on how to compensate the loss . The second rigid character of farming is that there had been no structural change over decades . Farming in Manipur focuses on production of only coarse cereals which is characterised by immediate consumption . In this era of globalisation farming should have close introspection of demand and supply model of consumers across the world . Especially in hilly areas , cultivation of coarse cereal is just to meet local consumption and not for earning profits . Nowadays , farmers stated cultivation of illegal crops such as poppy illegally in order to earn huge profit . In order to prevent this , government should emphasise on cultivation cash crops such yongchak ( parkia speciosa ) , cardamom , tea , coffee , black pepper , etc. since these crops are highly demanded in international as well as domestic market . On the other hand this can reduce environmental destruction which is followed after short period zoom cultivation . In plain areas also main crops are also coarse cereals which are vulnerable to low profit . Farmers should diversify in cultivation of cash crops such as black rice , medicinal plants , oil seeds , mushrooms , etc . Moreover farmers should engage themselves in nonfarm sectors wherein both farm and nonfarm sectors can be fitted in supply and demand schedule for their inputs and outputs . One of the institutional rigidities faced by the farmers is asymmetric information on the technological development in agricultural sector . Krishi Vigyan Kendras ( KVKs ) had been instituted in every districts across India in order to fill the information gap between farmers and agricultural scientists . However their works had been found confined to laboratories only and their expertises are hardly in the knowledge domain of farmers . Government should frame policies for KVKs so that they should be available to farmers at least once in a week on alternative blocks . Another institutional rigidity we witness is financial inaccessibility of farmers to existing financial institutions ( banks ) . In India , banks are found to release funds to manufacturing and service sectors but not on agricultural sector . Too much official procedures and rigid financial securities create inaccessibility of farmers to banks . So the banks should be advised to make survey on the constructive environment wherein farmers should accede and return loans in time . Another important institutional rigidity is lack of marketing institutions such as marketing farms and agents which can deal in such agricultural products . Government should invite both local and nonlocal farms which can link farmers with consumers at price determined by market rate . Government also should have policies such as Minimum Support Price and construction of Cold Storages so that various types of agricultural products can be available during their offseason .
