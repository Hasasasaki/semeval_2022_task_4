"An annual report on the state of education (aser), launched in Islamabad on Wednesday, shows some interesting facts and numbers. It notes progress in increasing access to education in Pakistan, since the number of children outside the school decreased from 25 to 22 million in accordance with government data. Nevertheless, it remains to be done. Without a compromise of access to school, the main attention should be focused on improving quality. The distribution of the budget for education is currently 3.02% of GDP, compared with 2.83% last year, but still does not reach the goal. At the bottom of the situation, it is that 19% of children aged 6-16 are still outside the school. The remaining 81%, which are enrolled in the age category 6-16, also study little. The seventh report on the ASER study also stood out in accordance with past trends that children enrolled in private schools work better than those who study in public schools. The number of children from school should be a cause for concern for the whole country and especially federal and provincial governments. It is quite obvious that poverty is the main reason that holds children away from schools and forces them to do some work to help supplement the income of their families. The problem can be solved to a large extent if the number of public schools increases significantly. State schools practically do not charge a fee, but they are not enough to satisfy the needs of the growing population. The distance coefficient and the participation of unbearable travel expenses are also forbidden to parents send their children to schools. In private schools in urban and rural areas in urban and rural areas, they satisfy the need for the segments of the Society of Medium and High income, but poor families cannot afford their children in these schools. Their owners should also understand that they also have social and national obligations, and offer some percentage of the total number of students from the poorest families for free. There are also problems of institutions, qualifications of the teaching staff and quality of education, and the government should at least offer educational institutions to all teachers, including those who work in private schools.",0

"Most of them of the desperately poor countries of Africa and, like tens of thousands of a year, were ready to risk a treacherous journey through the yemen who was torn by the war and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding a job in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Arab states of the Persian Gulf. But their plan should not have been. The detained by the Yemen authorities, 600 people or so men who are now awaiting deportation, prevented them from leaving their impromptu prison with armed soldiers. The conditions in the warehouse are increasingly desperate. A few days ago, the authorities ceased to distribute food and main materials. “I came from Djibuti to work. They gave us a small amount of food. If there is no food, we will die, ”said one migrant who refused to name his name. “If there is no decision, they will deport us to our countries or pull us out of here,” the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, for a long time was a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of which run from hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen went down into a comprehensive war in 2015. Hundreds of people are drowning every year in a dangerous sea voyage, and those who make it are faced with multiple risks, including death as a result of “attack, extortion and abuse of criminal networks, as well as the dangers associated with the war in Yemen itself,” the UN UNKB, and the United Nations Agency reported. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants passing through Aden and the Red Sea in Yemen is growing steadily, up to 117,000 in 2016 from 92,000 in 2015, the UN UNKB reports. Khaled al-Elvani, a local official who until recently watched the deportation of migrants back to his countries, says that every month they arrest up to 15,000 migrants. Elvani says that the Ministry of the Interior fired him for refusing to cooperate with the plan to move to the center to the neighboring province and after the authorities stopped food supplies. The ministry official told Reuters that the purpose of moving to a new institution was to improve the conditions for migrants while they expect deportation. Saudi Arabia and the coalition mainly Arab allies in the Persian Gulf fight for the restoration of Yemen's expelled government for the authorities and abandon the Huti -aligned Iran. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern regions, the budget crisis and rivalry with local armed groups mean that his officials mainly live abroad. Public services and wages were badly damaged by chaos, and African migrants, according to the visible, are a lower priority. Frightened people in aden’s warehouse, containing bread bought with meager savings and washing clothes in the outer space with garbage, are only the top of the iceberg.",1
